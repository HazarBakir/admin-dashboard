# Admin Panel (React + Vite)

This is a simple portfolio project: an admin panel built using React and Vite. It includes basic features like email updating, user check, and can be easily extended.

## Features

- Modern interface with React
- Update email functionality (with Supabase)
- Blocks unauthorized users
- Simple sidebar and header components

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
